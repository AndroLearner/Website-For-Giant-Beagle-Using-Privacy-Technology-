The Pharmacy is required by law to maintain the privacy of Protected Health Information ("PHI") and to provide individuals with notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to PHI. PHI is information that may identify you and that relates to your past, present or future physical or mental health or condition and related health care services or payment for those services. This Notice of Privacy Practices ("Notice") describes how we may use and disclose PHI to carry out treatment, payment or health care operations and for other specified purposes that are permitted or required by law. The Notice also describes your rights with respect to PHI about you.
The Pharmacy is required to follow the terms of this Notice. We will not use or disclose PHI about you without your written authorization, except as described in this Notice. We reserve the right to change our practices and this Notice and to make the new Notice effective for all PHI we maintain. Upon request, we will provide any revised Notice to you. We will also make copies available at our Pharmacies and post the new Notice on our website, www.giantbeagle.com.</div>

We will accommodate your request for a specific electronic form or format as long as we are able to readily produce a copy in the requested form or format.</div>
<div><b>Request an amendment of PHI.</b> If you feel that PHI we maintain about you in a designated record set is incomplete or incorrect, you may request that we amend it. You may request an amendment for as long as we maintain the PHI in a designated record set. You can file a complaint electronically and we will act upon it. You must include a reason that supports your request. In certain cases, we may deny your request for amendment.</div>
<div><b>Receive an accounting of disclosures of PHI. </b>You have the right to receive an accounting of the disclosures we have made of PHI about you for most purposes other than treatment, payment, or health care operations. The accounting will exclude certain disclosures, such as disclosures made directly to you, disclosures you authorize, disclosures to friends or family members involved in your care, and disclosures for notification purposes.
